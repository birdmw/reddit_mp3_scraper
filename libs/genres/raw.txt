Guidelines

/r/Music Posting Rules
No music from the Hall of Fame
No images
Instead post to one of these subreddits.
Artist - Title [Genre] Optional text
All submissions of streaming songs and albums must follow this format or will be removed.
Optional additional text may only be included after this part of the title. No ALL CAPS.
No artist reposts for 30 days if the previous post broke 100 points
No clickbait titles or asking for votes
Music should stand on its own. If you have an interesting story behind the music, you can add this in the comments or as self-post text.
Fridays are text post only
Friday is for interesting discussions, not streaming music. If your post is "low effort" or looks like just another way of posting streaming music, then it will be removed. Bad discussion posts are subject to removal on any day.
Saturdays are for fresh and original music
Dedicated to underground artists, your original compositions, and new releases by known artists. Well known tracks will be removed at mod discretion.
Submitters: For original music, use the "I Made This" flair. For new releases, use "New Release". You can select your flair beneath your link after posting.
No /r/ifyoulikeblank or /r/tipofmytongue style posts
For recommendations of new artists similar to those you already like, use /r/ifyoulikeblank. For help with identifying a song, use /r/tipofmytongue or /r/namethatsong.
Must link to official artist channels
Exceptions are made for exclusive releases or tracks not available on an artist's official channel.
No crowd funding sites
No links to unauthorized music leaks or promotion of piracy
Discussions and Articles should be directly relevant to music, music technology, or the music business itself
Articles / Tweets discussing statements by musicians not relevant to their work are not allowed. Articles discussing events in musician's lives are subject to mod discretion.
Follow reddiquette at all times.

Note to moderators

Subreddits must be older than one month to be added to this list. If your subreddit is still new, you should follow these steps:

Raerth's guide to starting a new subreddit will help you get started.
Make sure your subreddit has regular daily submissions, even if they are from the mods.
Edit your sidebar to tell visitors what your subreddit is for.
Make yourself a post in /r/Music promoting it.
Announce your subreddit in /r/NewReddits and /r/ShamelessPlug.
If and only if your subreddit is ALREADY active (more than one month, and lots of links and users), send a modmail to the /r/Music moderation team.
There is a private subreddit for music moderators called /r/MusicMods. This is a place to report spammers as well as enable communication and cross-promotion between all the subreddits. Check it.
